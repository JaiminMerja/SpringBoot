1. Print Count to a .txt File Every 15 Seconds Using File Handling and Threading Concepts
The count should append to the file without overwriting existing data.

2. Day Count Calculation Based on Different Statuses
Each working day has a status associated with it, and each status contributes differently to the final day count:

Present – contributes 0.35
Miss Punch – contributes 0.25
Work from Home (WFH) – contributes 0.50
Earned Leave (EL) – contributes 0.25

The program should calculate:

A final day count that sums up the contributions from each day.
An adjusted day count, ensuring that the total meets common values like 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, or 1.0.
All "Present" statuses should be grouped and summed into these rounded thresholds.
Leaves should also be handled and adjusted in the same way to reflect proper utilization.

3. Generate Work Schedule Based on Required Hours and Date Range
Create a program that accepts the following input parameters:

Start Date: (e.g., 2025-05-01)
End Date: (e.g., 2025-05-05)
Required Working Hours: (e.g., 32:00:00)

The program should return a list of working days (excluding weekends or non-working days such as Sundays), 
along with their associated start time and end time (e.g., 09:30:00 to 18:00:00).

For example:

Input:
  Start Date: 2025-05-01
  End Date: 2025-05-05
  Required Working Hours: 32:00:00

Output:
  [
    2025-05-01 09:30:00 to 18:00:00,
    2025-05-02 09:30:00 to 18:00:00,
    2025-05-03 09:30:00 to 18:00:00,
    2025-05-05 09:30:00 to 18:00:00
  ]
Note: May 4th (Sunday) is excluded.

4. Merge Data from Three Maps and Generate Final Report
You have three maps:

Map 1: Contains year, month, EL balance, and SL balance.
Map 2: Contains year, month, and present days.
Map 3: Contains year, month, and awarded EL, SL.

Using these three maps, generate a final map containing:

Year
Month
Total Working Days
Present Working Days

The final result should be grammatically correct and well-formatted. It should reflect the consolidated working day summary
 based on attendance and leave data.
